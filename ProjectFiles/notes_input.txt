My initial thoughts regarding input implimentation:
Create an input stream class NetlistReader with the following method:
- vector<string> next() -- extracts a line of the netlist and stores it in a
  vector of strings, skipping any comment lines marked with '*', returns empty
  vector once netlist reaches .end and should not be called again

This will allow for easy manipulation of the input to be stored in whatever
data structre we deem fit later on, where each returned vector will contain all
of the information necessary split into appropriate vector indexes:
i.e.  line[0] = designator + identifier
      line[1] = node0
      line[2] = node1
      line[3] = value (for 2 terminal devices), = node2 (for 3 terminal devices)
      line[4] = value (for 3 terminal devices)

Additional input process will have to be added to manage the specification of
SINE for voltage and current sources to correctly split into input params
