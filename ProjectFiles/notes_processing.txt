Using the Eigen template library to manipulate and manage matrices.
Whenever compiling, link the header using the following command:
g++ -I /usr/local/include/eigen-3.3.7 main.cpp -o program

NOTE: I have copied the eigen folder into /usr/local/include/ which should
allow normal compile commands
Eigen quickref guide: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__QuickRefPage.html

*INITIALISATION/CONSTRUCTION*
REMEMBER: #include <Eigen/Dense>
          using namespace Eigen;
MatrixXd = dynamically sized matrix of type double
VectorXd = dynamically sized vector of type double
MatrixNt = Matrix<type, N, N> (useful for conductance matrix)
Types (t) allowed:
- i (int)
- f (float)
- d (double)
- cf (complex<float>)
- cd (complex<double>)
You can stream values into an object using << operator:
i.e.  VectorXd v(3); //Creates a vector of size 3
      v << 1, 2, 3; //Fills the cells of the vector
      MatrixXd m(3,3);
      m << 1, 2, 3,
           4, 5, 6,
           7, 8, 9; //New lines not required, used for clarity

You can cout vectors and matrices directly using << operator

For constructors, the number of rows is always passed first:
i.e. MatrixXf a(10,15) creates a 10 row by 15 col matrix

*ELEMENT ACCESS*
To access elements in a matrix, the () operator is overloaded, where the row
index then column index is passed (counting starts at 0):
i.e.  MatrixXd m(2,2); //Constructs a 2x2 matrix
      m(0,0) = 3; //Allocates the value of 3 to the element at r1,c1
NOTE: Operator [] can also be used to access elements in a vector but not a matrices


*RESIZING*
- rows() returns number of rows
- cols() returns number of columns
- size() returns number of coefficients
- resize(int,int) resizes a dynamically allocated matrix
NOTE: use conservativeResize() if you do not want value of coefficients
I'm assuming this is an expensive operation so we want to minimise the amount
of times it is called, it is porbably worth going through the input and
determining the amount of nodes first, then creating a dynamic matric of that size
Using the = operator will automatically resize a matrix to match what it is being
made equal to.
NOTE: For sizes smaller than 16, using fixed size matrices is hugely beneficial
to performance, worth considering using these for smaller numbers of nodes
This can be done using the extra template parameters:
Matrix< typename Scalar,
        int RowsAtCompileTime,
        int ColsAtCompileTime,
        int Options = 0, //Dont fuck with this
        int MaxRowsAtCompileTime = RowsAtCompileTime,
        int MaxColsAtCompileTime = ColsAtCompileTime>
By creating Matrix<float, Dynamic, Dynamic, 0, 16, 16> this allows us to use a
'dynamically sized' matrix for smaller node sizes without actually using dynamic
memory allocation (might not be necessary provided number or nodes is known)


*ARITHMETIC*
Supported operators (objects must be the same size):
- binary operator + (a+b)
- binary operator - (a-b)
- unary operator - (-a or a*-1)
- compound operator += (a+=b)
- compound operator -= (a-=b)
scalar multiplication and division is also supported (both compound and binary operators)

Matrix manipulation:
- transpose()
- conjugate() -- complex matrices only (non-operation on real matrices)
- adjoint() -- conjugate transpose
NOTE: a=a.transpose(); does NOT transpose the matrix, DO NOT DO THIS!
      for in place transposition, use transposeInPlace() or adjointInPlace()

Matrix multiplication:
Both binary operator * and compound operator *= are supported (take care valid operations)
Member functions:
- dot(matrix) gives dot product
- cross(matrix) gives cross product

Reduction operations:
- sum() returns sum of elements
- product() returns product of elements
- maxCoeff() & minCoeff() return mac and min respectively


**LINEAR SOLVING**
Decompositions:
- ColPivHouseholderQR() QR decomposition with column pivoting, works on all
                        matrices while being quite fast
- PartialPivLU() Requries matrix to be invertible, faster but reduced accuracy
- LLT() Requires a positive definite matrix, fastest possible method, reduced accuracy
        NOTE: Our conductance matrix should be a positive (semi?)definite matrix

For 8x8 matrices, ColPivHouseholderQR() is 4.3x slower than LLT
NOTE: For optimisation, refer back to benchmark and use different methods for
      different sized matrices to balance accuracy and speeds for various sizes
Benchmarking of relative speeds: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__DenseDecompositionBenchmark.html

To solve an equation of the form Ax=b: (x and b are vectors)
VectorXd x = A.decomposition().solve(b);

To test the error margin of your solution:
double relative_error = (A*x - b).norm() / b.norm();
NOTE: In report discuss vector norms / matrix norms and what they represent (if space)

Advanced optimisation:
If time allows it might be worth using eigenvalue decomposition to determine
whether a matrix is definite / semi-definite to use faster decomposition methods
i.e.  SelfAdjointEigenSolver<MatrixXd> eigensolver(A);
      if(eigensolver.info() != Success) abort();
      cout<<eigensolver.eigenvalues()<<endl;
If all eigenvalues are positive our matrix is definite, if they are non-negative
our matrix is semi-definite.

For VERY SMALL matrices (4x4 max) it can be more efficient to call the following
methods directly to solve Ax = b:
- inverse() returns the inverse of a matrix
- determinant() returns the determinant of a matrix
NOTE: DO NOT USE THESE METHODS FOR LARGER MATRICES, SLOW AS FUCK

Not sure if more methods are required for what we want to do, more info available
