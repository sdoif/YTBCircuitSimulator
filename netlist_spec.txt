The following document describes the format for netlist files which are used to represent the 
circuit to be simulated.

*Components*
The netlist is described by lines defining the type, designator (name), nodes and value of each
component
Designator  Component       Node order  Value
V           Voltage source  +, -        Volts or function
I           Current source  In, out     Amps or function
R           Resistor        N/A         Ohms
C           Capacitor       N/A         Farads
L           Inductor        N/A         Henries

The format of each line is:
<designator> <node0> <node1> <value>

Designator
The designator field contains a letter and a number. The letter specifies the type of component (see above) 
and the number is added to make a unique identifier for each component

Node list
A list of two node names occurs after the designator. Node names have the format NXXX, where X is an int.
The component is connected to these nodes, in the order given in the table above. The reference
(ground) node is named 0

Value
The value is the component value in the units given in the table above. Numbers can be followed by
a multiplier:
Multiplier Value
p ×10-12
n ×10-9
u ×10-6
m ×10-3
k ×103
Meg ×106
G ×109

Voltage and current sources can have a DC value, or a function. The only function with support is a
sinusoid written in the form:
SINE(<dc offset> <amplitude> <frequency>)
DC offset and amplitude have units of Volts or Amps. Frequency has units of Hertz.

*Simulation settings*
The transient simulation is described with a line of the form:
.tran 0 <stop time> 0 <timestep>
Stop time is the duration of the simulation. Timestep is the resolution of the simulation. 0 fields are
included to maintain compatibility with SPICE.

*End of file*
The file ends with the line:
.end

*Comments*
The input file may contain comments on lines beginning with *
These lines will be ignored.
Extensions to the specification

*Example*
